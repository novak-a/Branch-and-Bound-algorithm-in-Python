# Branch and Bound algorithm in Python

We are given a set to tasks T = {t_1, ..., t_n}, where each task t_i âˆˆ T is characterized by its
release time r_i, deadline d_i and processing time p_i.

We want to find a feasible schedule (start times of the individual tasks; tasks cannot overlap)
such that the completion time of the last task (C_max) is minimal.
